Pictela's initial ad template offering based on standard IAB sizes which later expanded to include AOL's 300 x 1050 "Project Devil" ad format. Styleguides defining each ad format's configuration and best use practices were created and later distributed to publishers looking to adopt Pictela ads. Consulted on the design of additional ad units later on.
