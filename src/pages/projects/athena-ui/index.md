Athena UI (AUI) was a CSS framework and accompanying styleguide for products under the Athena Content Services brand. Built on top of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" class="link-external">Bootstrap 4</a> for added flexibility, it included custom UI components, a brand-specific color palette, and an icon font made in-house.
